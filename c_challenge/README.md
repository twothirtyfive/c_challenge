#Coding Challenge

This is a simple RESTful api meant to interact with a smart contract on the Ropsten TestNet.

Please reference requirements.txt for the dependencies for this project. (Web3, Flask)


To run up the server (highly recommended to use a virtual environment):

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

`export FLASK_APP = api.py`

`flask run`


Then use the (default) address `127.0.0.1:5000` to send requests and receive responses.
